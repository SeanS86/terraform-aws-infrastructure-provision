# Extra arguments for the dashboard deployment
# For example, to set the auto-generate-certificates flag (if not using your own certs)
# extraArgs:
#   - --auto-generate-certificates
#   - --namespace=kubernetes-dashboard # Ensure this matches where you deploy

# If you have your own certificates, you can specify them
# protocolHttp: false # Set to true if dashboard is accessed via HTTP (e.g. Ingress terminates SSL)
# certs:
#   keyFile: "" # Path to your key file within the container or a secret
#   certFile: "" # Path to your cert file

# We will create a separate ServiceAccount and ClusterRoleBinding for admin access later.
# For now, the dashboard will deploy, but you won't be able to log in with full admin rights
# until you set up the access token.
